TRAFIL
======
Installation instructions
-------------------------
TRAFIL uses a MySQL database in order to store and process tracefile data. In order to make TRAFIL functional, you need a MySQL installation, as well as an empty MySQL database for TRAFIL use only. Use those MySQL details to log in to TRAFIL. TRAFIL also requires that you have NS-2 installed in the default /usr/bin folder (or at least set in the PATH) if you use any of its simulation execution options.

Compatibility
-------------
TRAFIL currently only supports NS-2. NS-3 trace file processing is not tested, and therefore is not considered functional.

For any problems/bugs found, don't hesitate to contact me.
